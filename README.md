# Baby foot VAR

This software is a way to see replays of your great, totally controlled, table football goals using automatic infrared ball detection and your smartphone.

## Principle

The principle is to detect when the ball goes into the goal using a infrared distance sensor which will tell a computer that there was a goal. The computer, which is connected to a smartphone that acts as a webcam, then recovers the last 10 seconds (more or less this is up to you) to save them and display them back to the players.

## Requirements

### For the manual replays

- A working laptop (works on windows haven't tested the other ones)
- At least one smartphone with a camera
- A table soccer of course

### For the automatic replays

- All of the above
